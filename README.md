I'll try to just create a simple discord bot using the coding train's tutorial and the discordjs.guide website
For now, there will be a bunch of commands for playing/testing, but only the ones listed below will remain version after version

In the future I will try to create a discord bot that connects with chatgpt and can answer math/physics questions.

invite url: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1205590791108698142&scope=bot

Server functionalities:
- Reload command for debugging
- Kick/Ban

Useful Functionalities:
- Search for a uni assignment
- Helps with subway connections


Future posible functionalities:
- task manager
- music
- connection to chatgpt
	- math/physics questions
- alarm
- weather
- Links to important uni things (tps, forums)
