I'll try to just create a simple discord bot using the coding train's tutorial and the discordjs.guide website
For now, there will be a bunch of commands for playing/testing, but only the ones listed below will remain version after version

In the future I will try to create a discord bot that connects with chatgpt and can answer math/physics questions.
